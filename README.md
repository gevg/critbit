critbit
=======

An example implementation of a critbit tree in Go

It is based on Adam Langley's well documented critbit C implementation at https://github.com/agl/critbit

This version is not intended to be used as is (unless you need a simple string set).
Instead just copy and modify it according to your needs.
You can change it to use other types of keys or use it as a map.
